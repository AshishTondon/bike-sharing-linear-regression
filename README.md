## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
- The company have planned to understand driving variable which increase profits to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- The project is to drive out all predictor variables which increase number of bike renting.
- Dataset is of 2 years 2018 and 2019. The data contains per day number of bikes got rented.  

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- In Numerical variables, temp is most correlated with target variable(cnt).
- In categorical variables, yr is most correlated with target variable(cnt). 
- temp and atemp numerical variables were highly correlated with each other.
- Following are the preditor variables in final model:
  - yr
  - holiday
  - temp
  - windspeed
  - summer
  - winter
  - light_snow
  - September
